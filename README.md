Drum Generation with Self-Similarity Matrix (SSM)
==================

This is the supplemental material for ISMIR 2019 paper **GENERATING STRUCTURED DRUM PATTERN USING VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER AND SELF-SIMILARITY MATRIX**. The goal of this project is using machine learning model to generating drum patterns.
With SSM as song structure representation, we successfully demonstrate that it is possible to generate drum track with long-term consistency. This Project uses Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/ "link") to make the implementation easier.

Listening example is available [here](https://sma1033.github.io/drum_generation_with_ssm/ "link").
